# Thyroid Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

## üìö Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting thyroid disease using a Random Forest machine learning model. It leverages a dataset containing diverse features related to thyroid health, such as demographic information, medical history, and clinical test results.

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Age**: Patient's age at diagnosis or treatment.
- **Gender**: Patient's gender (male or female).
- **Smoking Status**: Whether the patient currently smokes.
- **Smoking History**: Past smoking history of the patient.
- **Radiotherapy History**: Any previous radiotherapy treatment.
- **Thyroid Function**: Indicators of thyroid function abnormalities.
- **Physical Examination**: Observations from a physical exam, including thyroid gland palpation.
- **Adenopathy**: Presence of swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
- **Pathology**: Types of thyroid cancer identified through biopsy.
- **Focality**: Whether the cancer is localized or spread to multiple areas.
- **Risk**: Cancer risk category based on tumor characteristics and spread.
- **T Classification**: Tumor size and local invasion extent.
- **N Classification**: Lymph node involvement.
- **M Classification**: Presence of distant metastases.
- **Cancer Stage**: Combined T, N, and M classifications to determine the cancer stage.
- **Treatment Response**: Response to treatment (positive, negative, or stable).
- **Recurrence**: Whether cancer has recurred after treatment.

## üîç Model Validation
To ensure reliable and generalized results, cross-validation is employed. This technique divides the data into multiple subsets to train and test the model on different combinations, reducing overfitting and providing a more accurate performance estimate.

## üéØ Hyperparameter Optimization
We perform hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance. This involves selecting optimal hyperparameters through methods like grid search or random search, leading to better accuracy and efficiency.

## üìä Performance Metrics
Model effectiveness is evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**: Ratio of correctly predicted instances to total instances.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.

## üìâ Learning Curves
Learning curves illustrate model performance over training iterations:

- **Training Curve**: Shows model performance on training data throughout the training process.
- **Validation Curve**: Displays how well the model performs on validation data during training.
